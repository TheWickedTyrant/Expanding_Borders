# **Expanding Boders 1.1.0 Patch Notes**

---
## **Bug fixes**

* The World Border now expands when initiated from the nether or the end


---

## **Balance changes**

* rebalanced many items notable changes are:
    * wither roses recieved a much bigger buff (they are now worth more then enderpearls)
    * heart of the sea, and conduit, now give a free border upgrade
    * the ore forms of minerals are now worth more then their processed counterparts
        * this is because they are technically finite, and you cannot farm them. some are worth more then
        others
    * tried to buff more farmables, so that you have an incentive to create more farms
