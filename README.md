# Expanding_Borders
A minecraft datapack that allows you to increase the worldborder by throwing items into a "Well of Sacrifice"; start with a small worldborder and increase it as much as you can! starting with limited resources, eventually you will be farming resources to expand automatically, maybe one day you will reach that mesa biome...
