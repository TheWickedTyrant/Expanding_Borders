-emerald and emerald block BP nerfed (16384|147456 --> 856|7704)
-changed the name of the well of sacrifice spawn egg to say "Well Of Sacrifice",
	 as well as changing the lore to instruct player what to do with the entity
-changed the pickup radius of the well of sacrifice from 0.5 blocks to 0.59 blocks
	this was to make it so that it could pick up items from the corner of the 
	block that the well sits in
-added the ability to break the well. When the well is broken it drops a new spawn
	egg for itself. there is no preferred tool to break the well, though hitting
	it with any tool will still cost durability
